# Exercises

Code for exercises in "Software Design for Flexibility" by Chris Hanson and Gerald Jay Sussman

## How to relate to this repository

1. You can add anything to the repository that might be helpful to others, and you can reorganize things that are there.
2. You don’t need to go through the PR review process if you don’t want to, but it might be helpful. I’d guess that it’s most helpful for getting feedback on exercise solutions. We can establish rules and norms later if this ends up too chaotic or if PRs don’t get merged.
3. If people make PRs I’m hoping that everyone who interacts with the repository will participate in the review process.

Same thing applies to the [experiments](https://github.com/compclub/experiments) repository. Let me (andreas@ought.org) know if there are additional repositories you want.
