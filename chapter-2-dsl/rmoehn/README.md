I'm using Clojure for the exercises because I want to keep it fresh in my mind.
I see little benefit (for myself) in learning the MIT/GNU Scheme ecosystem and
idiosyncrasies. Clojure is more powerful with fewer parentheses.

I'm not completing most of the exercises, since I assume the initial thinking
about the solution is the most valuable part for me. Of course, this omits the
ultimate validation of the idea, so I might end up fooling myself.
