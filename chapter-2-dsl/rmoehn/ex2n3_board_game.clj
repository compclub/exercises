;;; What do I still have to do to be fairly confident that I've practiced all
;;; the things that are relevant to the book?

;;; I'm not going to implement all the rules for checkers. At the bottom is a
;;; quick implementation of setting up the board, but that's as far as my
;;; patience goes.

;;; My main idea for the design is to separate the game state into the state on
;;; the board and the state off the board. And to distinguish between moves and
;;; plays.

(s/def ::game-state (s/keys ::board ::off-board ::player-in-control))

;;; - A move is the smallest action after which control returns to one of the
;;;   players.
;;; - A play is a sequence of moves, after which control returns to the other
;;;   play.
;;; - For example in chess, pushing a pawn to the end zone is a move.
;;;   Turning it into another piece is another move. Both moves together are a
;;;   play. Or, in checkers, a jump is a move and chained jumps form a play.
;;;
;;; The fact that a play hasn't ended yet is encoded in the off-board game
;;; state. I think this would let me address all the problems noted at the end
;;; of section 2.4.1.
;;;
;;;
;;; What they want in the book is an implementation of this function, as far as
;;; I understand:
;;;
;;;   generate-all-plays : (game, game-state) -> [play]
;;;
;;; This can be defined in terms of:
;;;
;;;   generate-all-moves : (game, game-state) -> [move]
;;;
;;; These functions are general. They rely on the game-specific rules being
;;; implemented as functions summarized by `game`. For a chess/checkers-like
;;; game, these top-level functions should be enough to define the game:
;;;
;;;   initial-state: -> game-state
;;;   generate-moves : (game-state, coords) -> [move]
;;;   process-move : (game-state, move) -> game-state
;;;
;;; The contents of the (get-piece board coords) and the contents of
;;; (off-board-state game-state) are specific to the game, too. Note that a
;;; piece doesn't contain its coords. â€“ In a real chess game, the coordinates
;;; aren't written on each piece, either. And it feels like a good idea to
;;; follow the physical analogue.
;;; (https://lispcast.com/building-composable-abstractions/)
;;;
;;; There are some more supporting functions. For example, it would probably be
;;; useful to get all the coordinates in which there are pieces in a game state.
;;; But these are less important and would emerge if I implemented the thing.
